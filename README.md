## Understanding V-Bucks

V-Bucks, or Vinderbucks, are the virtual currency used in Fortnite. Players can earn V-Bucks through gameplay, but many choose to purchase them directly. With V-Bucks, players can unlock various cosmetics, including character skins and dance emotes. Understanding how V-Bucks work and their importance in the game is crucial for any player looking to enhance their Fortnite experience.
